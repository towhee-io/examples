# Deepfake Detection

Deepfake techniques, which present realistic AI-generated videos of people doing and saying fictional things, have the potential to have a significant impact on how people determine the legitimacy of information presented online.

This deepfake detection bootcamp mainly includes one notebook for fake video detection. You can learn about deepfake detection solutions and basic concepts of [Towhee](https://towhee.io/) from these notebook tutorials.

## Learn from Notebook

- [Deepfake Detection](./1_deepfake_detection.ipynb)

In this notebook you will build a basic deepfake detection system with pretrained models. At the end, you are able to build up a playable deepfake detection system with 5 lines of code.
